          A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for
          enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time.
        </p>
        <p class="para2">
          Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: casual leisure
          which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity
          requiring little or no preparation, serious leisure which is the
          systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is
          substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and
          finally project-based leisure which is a short-term, often one-off,
          project that is rewarding.
